# Sample-Aware Database Tuning System with Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create an intelligent database tuning system that dynamically adjusts database parameters based on workload and performance metrics using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). This system aims to enhance the efficiency and performance of SQL databases by continuously monitoring their state and optimizing their configurations.

## Features
1. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Continuous monitoring of various database performance metrics such as query execution time, CPU usage, memory usage, I/O operations, etc.
   - Collection and storage of performance data for analysis.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Model**:
   - Implementation of a deep reinforcement learning model to learn and optimize database parameters.
   - The model will interact with the database environment, adjusting parameters and receiving feedback to improve performance iteratively.

3. **Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring and Adjustments**:
   - A user-friendly dashboard to visualize database performance metrics in real-time.
   - Interface to manually adjust parameters if necessary.
   - Display of reinforcement learning model decisions and their impact on performance.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The core programming language for developing the application.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training the reinforcement learning model.
- **SQL Databases**: The target databases to be tuned and optimized.
- **Dash/Streamlit**: Tools for creating interactive dashboards for real-time performance monitoring and parameter adjustments.
